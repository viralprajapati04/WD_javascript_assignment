Q-5:What are undeclared and undefined variables? 
Ans:Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword. 
Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.
If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”.

Q-6:Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? 
Ans:Creation of new element: New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method.
code example:
document.createElement("<tagName>");  
// Where <tagName> can be any HTML 
// tagName like div, ul, button, etc.

// newDiv element has been created
For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");

Q-7:What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? 
Ans:ViewState:ViewState is used for client-side state management, allowing the client to maintain state information directly on their browser,
which enhances the user experience by preserving data between postbacks.

SessionState:SessionState manages the state on the server-side, enabling the server to store user-specific data throughout a session. 
This method is useful for managing user information and preferences securely and efficiently.

Q-8:What is === operator?
Ans:Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are the same.
Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but their type is different the operation will return false. 

Q-9:How can the style/class of an element be changed?

6.continue statement
7.for...in statement
8.for...of statement

Q-12:How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
Ans:This operation is useful while dealing with user inputs, data from APIs, or when performing mathematical operations.
Here, we will explain all possible approaches to convert string to an integer.
Using Number() Method
Using Unary + Operator
Using parseInt() Method
Using Math.floor() Method
Using Bitwise Operator
Using Math.round() Method
Using BigInt() Constructor

Q-13:What is the function of the delete operator? 
Ans:The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more 
references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.

from opening a new or reloading the web page and allowing you to call the JavaScript through it.

Q-16:How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript? 
Ans:Navigating to a new page can be done using window. location. assign() . By using assign() , 
the user will be able to get back to the landing page using the “back” button, as this does not change the browser's history.

Q-17:What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript? 
Ans:It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content again so that's why it takes time. 
When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.
